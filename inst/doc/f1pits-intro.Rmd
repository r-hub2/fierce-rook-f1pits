# Vignette Info. Introduction:

The `f1pits` package provides datasets of Formula 1 race pit stops, extracted from [DHL website](https://inmotion.dhl/en/formula-1/fastest-pit-stop-award) and a function to visualize pit stop data.

This package can be considered complementary to the `f1dataR` package, which provides Formula 1 race data.

# Exemple step by step to use this package:

## Step 1: Pit Stops data

To extract the pit stop data for a specific race or an entire season, use the `pits()` function. Check the documentation for the different arguments of the function.

```{r message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
# Accessing the data, for example, round 1, Australian GP 2025:

pits(1,2025) -> pitdata

pitdata
```

The output generated is a tibble containing the columns:

**Pos.** (position according to pit stop time), **Team**, **Driver**, **Time (sec)** is the time (in seconds) of each pitstop, **Lap** (lap of the race; does NOT include sprint sessions), and **Points** (DHL points. If a driver makes more than one pit stop among the top 10 fastest, the second and subsequent pit stops by that driver do not receive points).

## Step 2 (if you want): Plotting

The `f1pits` package includes the `pitplot()` function, which takes the data obtained from `pits()` and produces a ggplot object to visualize pit stop performance. Remember that if you want to provide your own data, the input must be a tibble (see the documentation of `pits()`). Check the documentation for the different arguments of `pitplot()` before using it.

```{r message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
# Plotting the data:

pitplot(pitdata,1) -> pitplot_pitdata

pitplot_pitdata
```
